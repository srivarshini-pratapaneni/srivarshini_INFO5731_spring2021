review 1,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.

this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.",everi movi come truli make impact joaquin perform scenographi brillianc grotesqu hunt cring hard watch time mesmer wont blink eye watch tragic serious funni moment emot rollercoast sometim multipl emot pop time far typic actionriddl predict superhero movi proper psycholog thrillerdrama singl best charact develop ever seen,,positive

review 3,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film.

review 4,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime",joaquin phoenix give tour de forc perform fearless stun emot depth physic imposs talk without referenc heath ledger oscarwin perform dark knight wide consid definit liveact portray joke let talk fact everyon go stun phoenix accomplish mani thought imposs portray match potenti exce dark knight clown princ crime,,positive

Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before.

review 6,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT.

review 8,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.

Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.

It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.

Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).

I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",seen joke yesterday venic earli inflat screen troubl audit lead nearhour delay definit worth joke deserv present venic film festiv event regard cinema form art film far blockbust mere entertain movi film gene focus psychic main charact slowli crumbl pressur societi thu joaquin phoenix wonder perform earn almost sure nomin scar least take joke differ ledger id say equal good main differ might ledger joke ration act insan phoenix insan root despit movi superhero villain joke much superior move gene id exclud dark knight trilog joke easili good plan move least close smallscal film distinct style cinematographi can not appreci set cinephil refer howev feel forc overlay oppress notabl similar scorses taxi driver king comedi also chain modern time somewhat refer eager see noncomed effort told phillip movi far probabl best 2019 worst contest far door gloria upon time hollywood convinc,,positive

review 12,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.

review 16,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong. I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie. What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!",quit reli critic review year ago notic movi critic rate low viewer rate high said point critic movi oh wrong went saw tone mon went skeptic w low expect knew expect typic super hero movi got masterpiec went expect sheer boredom instead edg seat whole time action edg seat fear may say next edg seat see charact evolv know 1 villain batman beyond geniu joaquin phoenix true master perfect art consum charact may place dont care movi stori act direct effect everyon brought game up definit deserv nod win role comparison jack nicholson heath ledger actor took charact differ level differ stori point differ point time comparison would feasibl fair actor embrac made come life geniu way,,positive

I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker.

review 20,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.

I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.

review 22,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.

Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.

Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.

review 24,"The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.

I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.

Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.

Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$",recur theme mani 10 star review tell lot movi audienc can get movi review without toss one claim movi much better smarter superhero movi even basin entir review around premis hate break kid your nowher near intellig grown think comic publish better is left behind grade school playground absolut relev qualiti movi opinion movi consid highli suspect your group gutta say movi also idea perfect film ever made realli need get look get live safe littl box watch superhero move mainstream blockbust understand exposur theme like first time would seem new excit think agre probabl best do comic relat movi last decad though that high bar meet cours joaquin phoenix talent actor stop take step back look thing joke inde present theme import societi neglect demon mental ill degre sometim creat monster everyon around seen come mile away hadn busi look away avoid feel uncomfort unfortun remind u fact situat still exist movi realli say danc around import subject like hey kiss class inequ never offer actual insight usual busi make forc batman refer drop cring littl edg moment like dont smile sign scene seem design sole someth hot topic print new shirt everi singl plot twist telegraph far advanc lot u seen exact twist mani time want impress perhap actual standalon movi instead shock complet unnecessari tie batman univers could done someth interest theme dont get wrong dont problem superhero move feel gratuit someon came idea pitch execut told sound great make batman movi somehow in sorri in movi tri tell hardheart yet deadseri speech mental ill modern societi simultan constantli remind technic superhero movi,,positive

I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many.

this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.

I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.

Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.

I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGG

phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.

review 31,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli.

review 41,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography. Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care. Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker. I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight. Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors. Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away 1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.",1010 amaz stori brilliant take magnific cinematographi someon step safe game play superhero move joke movi also boy movi gritti real insan dark sometim quit disturb peopl dont want accept what shown movi terribl realiti face everyday refus proper care normal peopl start compar movi one greatest like dark knight act wise heath ledger betray joke wouldn say movi better otherwis stand tall amongst greatest like godfath taxi driver citizen lane dark knight come inevit comparison who better joke heath joaquin answer phenomenon job joke charact fortun play two greatest actor definit top contend scar person think would take away best actor 2cinematographi origin score upon time hollywood lose make hairstyl categori would definit joke,,positive

review 43,"The whole point of this movie is to bring attention to mental illness (I'll do you one better and name a bigger issue than mental illness that the film barely focuses on; the lack of quality mental healthcare) but the film completely discredits its own message with a one dimensional depiction of most of the world and characters that inhabit it. It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie.

There is no way that Joaquin's Joker will ever fill the shoes of the badass Joker in the comics, not even the different incarnations by different comic authors....and just forget about even coming close to Heath Ledger's portrayal.

review 50,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea.

Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.

Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.

With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.

The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.

The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.

With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker.

review 55,"This movie answers this question...what will the Joker be if he was a real life character ? A great deep and moving story, a life journey of a man who's suffering from some psychological issues and how neglect, bullying and rudeness by other human being can push a man to complete madness.

Although it's not accurate to any comic book adaptation or any TV series or movie before it, yet it's a fresh and unique take on the character of the clown prince of crime from a realistic approach and I believe with Joaquin Phoenix amazing performance as the Joker in which he managed to bring a real life look-alike early version of the Joker which although is not comic book accurate but I feel it's a very decent foundation for Joker 2 which should be more true to heart of the original version of our lovable villain.

The movie is over all a great piece of filmmaking in all of its aspects. From the plot which was very interesting, believable and many can relate to it, through the acting which was impressively splendid to the directing which was outstanding. My main take on the movie is the lack of any positive lead character, I know we live in a tough world which full of negativity but there are some positive examples here and there and to shed some light on one or two characters in this movie would've been a nice positive thought.

The Joker movie can be misunderstood by many thinking it'll inspire crime and violence but I believe on the contrary that many who go through hard life will feel sympathy for the Joker character, others will even relate to his misery and may justify his actions. I believe the movie is meant to be a wake up call for many! A lot of people daily suffer from bullying, racism, hate crimes or neglect and sometimes they go through worse, we should take a deeper look at our actions and know that - aside from money and authority - we are all equally humans, we should treat one another the same way we expect to be treated.",movi answer questionwhat joke real life charact great deep move stori life journey man who suffer psycholog issu neglect build rude human push man complet mad although accur comic book adapt to seri movi yet fresh uniqu take charact clown princ crime realist approach believ joaquin phoenix amaz perform joke manag bring real life lookalik earli version joke although comic book accur feel decent foundat joke 2 true heart origin version movabl villain movi great piec filmmak aspect plot interest believ mani relat act impress splendid direct outstand main take movi lack posit lead charact know live tough world full nativ posit exampl shed light one two charact movi would nice posit thought joke movi misunderstood mani think till inspir crime violenc believ contrari mani go hard life feel sympathi joke charact other even relat miseri may justifi action believ movi meant wake call mani lot peopl daili suffer build racism hate crime neglect sometim go wors take deeper look action know asid money author equal human treat one anoth way expect treat,,positive

review 64,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a dishonest, knee-jerk defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their gaslighting charade might get uncovered. It is not Joker that is delusional, it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.

But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.

When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.

All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so.

review 69,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!

Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.

Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.

My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.

Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.

review 70,"Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted. I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it. Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention.

review 80,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!

review 84,"""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.

There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying...

review 85,"This film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.

They've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.

Arthur has no depth or personality. This movie was so boring I started falling asleep. Anyone who things those movie is a deep and meaningful masterpiece clearly has not seen other movies. I can list off so many other movies that are much more moving and deep than this. All this movie does is try to show that the villain, The Joker, from the comics is a distraught weak man.

review 103,"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.

Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.

When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?

review 105,"While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""

Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.

However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.

This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either.

review 107,"This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.

This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial's story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.

Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker's history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This ""man"", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.

Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.

review 108,"What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.",say hasn alreadi said terribl film great even realli good one either technic aspect great score cinematographi realli good mani individu scene also good whole feel unnecessari tone deaf well tri say mental ill problemat realli sure tri say even tri say anyth instead ad well easi right joaquin phoenix realli expel mani scene film in sure would want win oscar overal also interest kind bore time joke film bore that crucial offens guess everyon entitl opinion serious wonder peopl call masterpiec even seen taxi driver king comedi,,negative

review 116,"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.

PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie.

review 117,"My husband and I went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. Moreover, everything is caricatured. What could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown? Christopher Nolan, the director of the famous Batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. Simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. If you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! What others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine. Here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. As if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! But no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt in their heads. Something was wrong in them from the start. Here, the director wanted to make us cry by portraying roughly the most cartoonish misery. Everything is in bold capital letters, underlined and highlighted to be sure that we fully understood that the main character didn't have an easy life and that our society is so rotten that we should all revolt and suicide out of desperation or kill each other to put an end to it all. ""Why so serious ? ""asked the Ledger Joker. And that's a good question, because I'm worried about the future of this character, especially for the actors who will want to play him. In terms of the actor's performance, that's Joaquim Phoenix pushed to the extreme all over. In all his films I remember, this actor plays social misfits, loners unable to make friends, depressive people or on the verge of a nervous breakdown, misunderstood guys, sons rejected by their fathers, rebels, etc. In short, he only plays tortured souls. He even played a guy who falls in love with his computer because he can't get along with a real girlfriend. So it's normal that he knows how to play a crazy clown. Talent? If you will, considering the fact that he seems unable to play much else. This simplistic and gloomy depiction of society has already claimed victims. There are people who dress up as clowns and ransack everything in the streets and cinemas where the film is shown. It seems that some misfits wanted to believe that, as with the Joker, their misfortune depended on everything and everyone else. Their happiness couldn't certainly be up to themselves. Anyway, don't believe the good things that are said about this movie. And if you feel a bit out of sorts, don't go to see it, you'll make yourself more unhappy for a film that's really not worth it.",husband went see film found extrem depress moreov everyth caricatur could normal might say given depict life comic book clown christoph woman director famou batman trilog said produc movi would useless simpli come horror le show career your told giant monster wood eat peopl you laugh believ you imagin horribl monster horribl accord other show u never horribl u imagin make thing realli aw sink worst possibl melodrama psychopath mistreat childhood mock adolesc misunderstood adulthood without ever anyon help effect vast major born miss bolt head someth wrong start director want make u cri portray roughli cartoon miseri everyth bold capit letter undermin highlight sure fulli understood main charact didn easi life societi rotten revolt suicid desper kill put end seriou ask ledger joke that good question in worri futur charact especi actor want play term actor perform that joaquim phoenix push extrem film rememb actor play social visit lover unabl make friend depress peopl verg nervou breakdown misunderstood gun son reject father rebel etc short play tortur soul even play guy fall love comput can get along real girlfriend normal know play crazi clown talent consid fact seem unabl play much el simplist gloomi deduct societi alreadi claim victim peopl dress clown ransack everyth street cinema film shown seem visit want believ joke misfortun depend everyth everyon el happi couldn certainli anyway dont believ good thing said movi feel bit sort dont go see you make unhappi film that realli worth,,negative

review 117,"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0?

review 118,"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.

The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.",didn realli know much movi hadn seen trailer anyth decid give go stone mate steve actual got ticket differ movi couldn find screen end screen show joke want til 45 minut realis movi good couldn understand lot certain actor say realli mumbl low qualiti stori confus hard keep track who there lot scene liter noth happen except peopl talk walk corridor whisper mate steve hour see thought bad fallen asleep good thing movi act deeper play joke good also funni scene near end movi overlay long complex enough action poor direct,,negative

Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.

review 121,"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.",now movi admit first heard joaquin phoenix go joke surpris want sure go pull hope want go anoth chees condit full fluff realist explan joke came one adult son wouldn keep nudg wake pleasantli surpris well told phillip version play joaquin act superb could feel anguish charact go right point lost mind excel well act movi almost forget deriv do comic,,positive
review 122,"While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""

Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.

However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.

This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance.",enjoy film felt pretti short end appear screen couldn help think that joaquin phoenix fantast new take joke mesmer see facial express keep chang joke laugh uniqu sinist full joke mad howev despit minor plot twist interest bit film alreadi shown trailer dont expect much action like dark knight trilog despit much hope gun violenc le gun movi batman flick bad film great one either watch joaquin perform,,positive
